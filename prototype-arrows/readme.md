# What to implement
In this prototype, I will try to implement some kind of arrow functionality. It should be rotatable.

For this one, shooting an arrow towards mouse direction should be enough.

# Implemented
Basic arrow spawning using space key. The arrows have rotation. This rotation was hard to implement properly.
